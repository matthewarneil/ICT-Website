                    <h2>How We Chose Our Offices</h2>
                    <p>When Hot Beans Web founders Blake Thompson and Riley Watson were searching for their first office space, they found exactly what they were looking for close by. They were drawn to an old brick warehouse just a few blocks away from their favorite Seattle coffee shop. The buildingâ€™s raw, industrial charm resonated with them and they saw it as a physical representation of their own journey. With hard work and creativity, they could turn it into something truly remarkable. The location was ideal, situated in the heart of a tech-driven district. The building provided ample space for growth, and its aesthetic matched their innovative, coffee-fuelled vibe. Today, the Hot Beans Web office not only serves as a workspace, but also represents their beginnings and the changes they bring to the digital world.</p>
